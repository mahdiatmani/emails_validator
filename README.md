# emails validator (all ISPs)
This is a Python script that checks whether an email list is valid by verifying all parameters, such as syntax, mail server, and connection.
1. Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes only. I will not be held responsible for any misuse or abuse of the project.
2. Please ensure that port 25 is open on your network or machine. Alternatively, you can test it on a VPS that has the SMTP service running on port 25.
3. Please note that the script currently checks one email address at a time. Bulk testing for multiple email addresses will not be available due to security reasons.
4. For faster result you may need to split the terminals into 4 or more also split your data (emails1.txt , emails2.txt ...)
